Hi! My name is Brendon, and I'm a junior at Carnegie Mellon University majoring in mathematics with a statistics concentration. I also plan on minoring in computer science and computational finance. Some things I'm interested in are <span class="emphR">data visualization</span>, <span class="emphR">sports analytics</span> (especially baseball), and <span class="emphR">discrete math</span>.

At CMU I also play <a href = "https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/ultimate/yuk/">Ultimate Frisbee</a> and work as a SI Leader, where I run weekly review sessions for historically challenging math courses.
