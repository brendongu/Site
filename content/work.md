## <span class="emphR">Tableau Iron Viz 2020</span>

I submitted a visualization to the 2020 Tableau Iron Viz Qualifier!

I gathered and compiled data about diets and created a long-form interactive visualization in Tableau for the qualifier competition.

## <span class="emphR">ML Algorithm Implementation</span>

As part of the course 10-301 Introduction to Machine Learning, I implemented several ML algorithms from scratch using Python and numpy including:
- decision trees
- logistic regression
- stochastic gradient descent
- backpropagation
- forward-backward algorithm
- Q-learning

These were used to implement end-to-end systems that were able to learn several interesting tasks, such as sentiment polarity analysis, handwritten letter classification, named entity recognition, and solving the OpenAI Gym Mountain Car environment.

## <span class = "emphR">Big Data Bowl</span>
With my partner Peter Wu, I participated in the 2019 Big Data Bowl, a sports analytics contest in which contestants used NFL player tracking data to analyze and rethink trends and player performance. 

Our team was selected as one of **four college finalists** for this event and we were able to present our findings to members of the NFL league office, team executives, and league sponsors at the 2019 NFL Combine in Indianapolis, which was an awesome experience.

We used statistical modeling in R to create an expected catch probability model and used this model to consider new standards for pass interference; in our paper we proposed a novel two-level system for interference calls.
