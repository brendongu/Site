The process of setting up a personal website(this website, in fact) has been a fairly stressful and arduous one, though most of that was due to my lack of experience, not the tools I was using. This post will mostly be about the many mistakes I made and what I learned from them, but I'll also write about how this "final" site was built. 

### Starting Out

Creating a personal website was always something I had in the back of my mind as something I'd like to explore if I had time, but I never seriously looked into it. However, when my summer internship was canceled, I suddenly had 3 months of free time where I would likely be at home with nothing to do. I started researching the options for creating a website around the end of spring semester and I quickly decided I wanted a static site, which has a fixed layout and static code. They are easier to create and I had no need for any of the benefits of a dynamic site. 

The first platform I tried was <b>blogdown</b>, an R package that allows you to create a static website using R Markdown and Hugo.
